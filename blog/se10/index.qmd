## Overview

This blog post discusses the
[Documentation](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch10.html) chapter in
the [Software Engineering at Google book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book).
The chapter looks into the importance of documentation in order to ensure that
ideas in code are communicated efficiently. Let's dive into the chapter and see
what constructive tips we can take away from it so that we can improve the work
of our engineering team!

## Summary

This section of `Software Engineering at Google` deals with the importance of
documentation and how it makes the usage and maintenance of code much easier
when you can read about the processes that a codebase takes. Documentation in
this sense is not just about how the code is run, but all of the work put into
the code to make it readable such as descriptive notes and tutorials. Good
documentation makes code more comprehensible and allows for quicker transitions
for new developers working on the project. This not only gives your project a
cleaner look but also allows for fewer questions and confusion which could save
a lot of time down the road. One of the main problem with the documentation,
however, is that the benefits of writing it are not immediately known and it is
very time-consuming to make. This causes a lot of developers to write it off or
delay it, then when other developers need to understand this code there is
nothing to help them. However, the writing of documentation is vital to a
project's long-term success for users to understand changes and features in
code.

According to those working at Google, documentation should be treated the same
way as code is. In this way, documentation needs to be maintained, have a
consistent style, and should avoid grammar errors. Ensuring that documentation
is periodically tested and reviewed to make sure that they are accurate and
follows the modern goals of the tool. To do this each section of documentation
needs an owner or a group of owners that are responsible for creating
documentation for commands. These groups would be responsible for their sections
of code to be clear and maintained, allowing for long-term maintenance of each
section of this documentation.

Another point to consider when making documentation is to know who you are
writing your documentation for. Often writers of documentation write it only
with their own goals in mind, here are some questions writers need to think of:

 - Are you writing for someone with many years of development experience or only a few weeks?
 - Are you writing for a developer on your team or the general public?
 - What information do your users need to know first and what last?

All of these questions need to be considered when making documentation to make
this writing as useful as possible to your users as documentation that is too
complicated could confuse people outside of your team if you are not specific
enough.

The type of documentation style you use is also something that needs to be
considered as different types of notes can help with different internal issues.
Reference documentation is one of the most important versions of documentation
as it references direct code sources in code segments. File, class, and function
comments are some of the most common that help us explicitly state what
different sections of code do. Design documents are another type of
documentation that enforces design choices made for different projects, these
documents are made before projects are started so that code can be standardized
in the entire project. In-depth tutorials are also very helpful as they can
explain exactly how processes are run which can help new users get up to running
quickly. Conceptual documentation is high-level documentation that gives less
in-depth information as it is an issue that is more complicated than reference
documentation. These documents cover processes that cannot be lowered down to
specific sections of code but rather a larger, more theoretical process.
Finally, landing pages are good documents to make to ensure that developers
going to your documents for the first time have a guide on where they should go
to best fix their issues.

In the end, The creation of documentation is a team-based endeavor that requires
a lot of effort to set up but is worth it in the long run. Good documentation
should have a clear intended audience while also trying to balance accuracy and
completeness to be as helpful as possible for your audience. This documentation
needs to be maintained also it needs to be able to stay up to date as new
features are added, ensuring that all features of your tool will be understood
by your audience.

## Reflection

The chapter on [Code
Documentation](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch10.html) provides us
with important information on how documentation is important, despite the fact
that some engineers consider it "downstream" or unimportant. Nonetheless,
despite its appearance of unimportance due to its lack of immediate benefits,
the article shows us how documentation is an extremely important aspect of
programming and software engineering by explaining how it promotes education
among software teams as to what the code does and answering questions about its
effectiveness, as well as increasing professionalism and allowing the
formulation of plans related to the rest of the project.

## Action Items

We should establish a universal outline or format for documenting code that
ensures consistency across both projects, making it easier for team members to
navigate and understand the code. Since different team members might contribute
in various ways or focus on different aspects of the code, having a flexible yet
standardized documentation format allows for a cohesive and comprehensive
overview. Doing this ensures that our code will be more accessible to people
working on the tool now and people who will work on it in the future.
