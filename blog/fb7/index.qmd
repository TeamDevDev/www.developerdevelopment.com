## Overview

This article discusses the [Efficient Grammar
Fuzzing](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/GrammarFuzzer.html) chapter from [The
Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/), exploring how its content could
potentially be useful to the development of our tool,
[chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten). This article builds on the
[Fuzzing with Grammars](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Grammars.html), aiming
for a better implementation. Let's learn more!

## Summary

This chapter opens with outlining the issues with the `simple_grammar_fuzzer`
introduced previously, which are that it is inefficient and hard to control. It
can continue adding parentheses indefinitely, for example, and has a complexity
of $O(n^2)$ as part of this. Therefore, **derivation trees** are now
introduced, which are a form of visualization for the steps of a grammar. Below
is an example of a tree built from the expression `2 + 2`.

This representation works well for a higher-level understanding, but is not a
feasible way to show in code as that stands. The code representation is
possible through the use of a combination of tuples and lists, using the
formula `(SYMBOL_NAME, CHILDREN)`. The following source code example shows how
to combine tuples and lists to express a derivation tree:

```python
DerivationTree = ("<start>",
                   [("<expr>",
                     [("<expr>", None),
                      (" + ", []),
                         ("<term>", None)]
                     )])
```

Each node has its own sub-nodes, until it reaches the outermost "leaves" of the
derivation tree. Using this, the chapter then outlines how to add functionality
for traversing and expanding nodes/whole trees using the methods it defines for
a `GrammarFuzzer` class. What follows is an example of a method for expanding a
node randomly for fuzzing purposes:

```python
class GrammarFuzzer(GrammarFuzzer):
    def choose_node_expansion(self, node: DerivationTree,
                              children_alternatives: List[List[DerivationTree]]) -> int:
        """Return index of expansion in `children_alternatives` to be selected.
           'children_alternatives`: a list of possible children for `node`.
           Defaults to random. To be overloaded in subclasses."""
        return random.randrange(0, len(children_alternatives))
```

From there, limits are defined for maximum and minimum costs as another manner
of expanding that is less random. The minimum costs help with closing the tree,
to avoid some of the concerns about inefficiency surrounding the
`simple_grammar_fuzzer`. An example of expanding by minimum costs is presented
in the following source code segment:

```python
class GrammarFuzzer(GrammarFuzzer):
    def expand_node_min_cost(self, node: DerivationTree) -> DerivationTree:
        if self.log:
            print("Expanding", all_terminals(node), "at minimum cost")

        return self.expand_node_by_cost(node, min)
```

And then the expanding by maximum costs, good for using to start the tree,
works as follows:

```python
class GrammarFuzzer(GrammarFuzzer):
    def expand_node_max_cost(self, node: DerivationTree) -> DerivationTree:
        if self.log:
            print("Expanding", all_terminals(node), "at maximum cost")

        return self.expand_node_by_cost(node, max)
```

These three forms of expansion can be applied together in order to achieve a
more efficient form of fuzzing with grammars. By using the `GrammarFuzzer`
class and the methods created for it, tests can be generated much more quickly,
with the trade-off of creating smaller inputs that we have increased control
over.

## Reflection

This chapter helped to grow my understanding of grammar-based fuzzing. Before,
I would not have known that there were more ways to perform grammar-based
fuzzing. Grammar Fuzzing focuses on the concept of grammar-based fuzzing and
highlights some of its initial flaws as well as how to address and debug them.
There are also many drawbacks associated with grammar-based fuzzing, such as
efficiency, infinite loops, and bugs that can occur by not paying careful
attention to the grammar rules set in place. Here are two concepts to remember:

- **Derivation Trees**: Deviation trees are a visual representation of the grammar
of a string. They create a tree-like structure that breaks down the grammar
into smaller and smaller components until you reach the end of the tree.
Deviation trees are useful for understanding how a string conforms to its
grammar and identifying deviations or errors.

- **Grammar Implementation**: The chapter discusses how to implement grammars
in data structures such as tuples and lists. This is a crucial step in
grammar-based fuzzing, as it defines the rules and structures that the fuzzer
will use to generate test cases.

The use of grammar-based fuzzing can be a powerful tool for testing software,
but this also has many trade-offs. Simple grammar fuzzing can be really
inefficient, especially when dealing with large grammars and complex language
structures. These inefficiencies become apparent as the function has to iterate
over the generated string, searching for matching symbols.

## Use Cases

The implementation of efficient grammar fuzzing, as described in the chapter,
offers a good opportunity for improving the testing of our code in the
development of Chasten. Since our tool checks XPath expressions, using the
three-phase expansion approach would create a highly efficient testing tool.
Here is an example of an XPath, `//FunctionDef/element[position() = 3]` this
selects the third element node within a FunctionDef node. This specific pattern
narrows down the selection to a particular position within the document
structure, exploring different variations or alterations of this pattern is
essential in testing to cover diverse scenarios. An efficient fuzzer can
generate a multitude of XPath expressions with various modifications, like
changing the positional value, using different node types, or incorporating
more conditions.
