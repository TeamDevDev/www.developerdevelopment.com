## Overview

This is our first post about the [Software Engineering at Google
book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book)! The goal of this post is to relate
the material from the book to our progress on our Chasten tool, with the hope
that it will provide valuable lessons on how we approach designing and
developing our own software.

## Summary

The ["Programming Over
Time"](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/pr01.html#programming_over_time)
section introduces the idea that software engineering encompasses more than just
writing code &mdash; it also involves creating processes that enable the
development of maintainable and sustainable software. The preface makes it clear
that, instead of viewing a software release as the final version, it should be
seen as a foundation for continuous improvement. To achieve sustainability and
growth, the book emphasizes three key aspects:

- **Time**: To ensure that software is designed for future enhancements, it's
crucial to plan how it will evolve from project inception to completion. This
involves structuring code in a way that allows for future improvements and bug
fixes.

- **Scale**: As the engineering team grows or contracts, it's essential to plan
how engineering practices will adapt to accommodate changes in team size and
structure.

- **Costs**: Prioritization of software engineering tasks is vital. It's
necessary to establish a clear understanding of which project tasks should take
precedence, considering time constraints and resource availability.

These principles not only facilitate software development but also highlight the
importance of making well-informed trade-offs when necessary.

## Reflection

As outlined in the [developer development schedule](../../schedule/index.qmd),
we are embarking on a sixteen-week adventure to build two production-quality
software tools. This reflective content is relevant to
[Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten), a tool that we are building
to automatically search for source code patterns using XPath expressions.
Reflecting on our project's progress so far, we've recognized the need to
prioritize scaling, emphasizing clear planning and communication as our team
tackles a significant project with limited experience. Given our constrained
time-frame, we must carefully weigh the importance of features against their
implementation cost. Google's software engineering practices emphasize the
importance of a shared team goal and code durability, guiding us in building a
resilient and adaptable product.

## Action Items

We can adopt the principles and concepts from the [preface of the Software
Engineering at Google book](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/pr01.html)
to enhance the development and maintenance of Chasten as a critical
computational biology and physiology library. By focusing on sustainability,
adaptability, and rigorous engineering practices, we improve the likelihood that
Chasten will serve the scientific community. We have a lot to learn about this
process --- but we look forward to the adventure!
