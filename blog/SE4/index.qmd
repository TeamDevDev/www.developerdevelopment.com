## Overview


## Summary


## Reflection

This article is very important for the work we are doing on chasten as we need to be able to communicate effectively in the small amount 
of time we have together each week. Overall we have done an okay job of this but we beleive that we could improve on these with a few 
changes. Alot of time when working on chasten, we struggle to make information widely avaliable especially when it comes to our 
individual pull requests and issues, this can cause a lot of problems for a few reasons. For one, this information will be lost if a 
member is sick or leaves the team and we will have to start again from scratch. Then, even if the issue is solved by this single person, 
others will still have to review the information. This means that if an error was present from the start of the change, then the pull 
request will have to be scrapped and potentally redone. To fix problems like this, we should greate smaller teams that allow for members 
to discuss the changes they are making and find a solution to these problems. As a team, it is important to always be on the same page. 
Making sure no ones work goes unoticed, or whether its just talking about how to attack something. Everyone just needs to be on the same 
page.

## Action Items
effective communication is crucial due to limited weekly meeting time. While we've done okay so far, there's room for improvement. 
Often, we struggle to share information, especially regarding individual pull requests and issues. This creates various issues, such as 
losing critical information when team members are unavailable or leave. Even if one person resolves an issue, others must review it, 
potentially leading to problems like errors being overlooked initially. To address this, we should consider forming smaller teams that 
can discuss changes and collaboratively find solutions. This will help streamline our communication and problem-solving processes.
