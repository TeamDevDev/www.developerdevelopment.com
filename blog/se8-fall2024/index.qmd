## Overview

Style guides are essential tools for scaling and sustaining engineering teams.
They define rules that align with project values, fostering consistency,
readability, and maintainability. However, creating effective rules requires
thoughtful consideration—rules should advance specific goals, be optimized for
readers, and avoid introducing unnecessary complexity. 

Google’s approach emphasizes balance: rules must be impactful without being
overly restrictive, and exceptions should be allowed when justified by practical
needs. Automation tools like linters and formatters help enforce rules
consistently, while regular reviews ensure style guides evolve with the needs of
the team and the industry. By focusing on practical, evidence-based principles,
teams can craft style guides that enhance both code quality and developer
efficiency.

## Summary

### Why Have Rules?

This chapter discusses the importance of rules and style guides in software
engineering, focusing on their role in promoting consistency, readability, and
effective collaboration. It outlines the process of creating and evaluating
rules, emphasizing the need for rules to align with organizational values and
goals. The chapter also highlights the balance between maintaining consistency
and allowing for practical exceptions when necessary. It explores principles for
writing effective style guides, such as optimizing for the reader, avoiding
error-prone constructs, and making rules that can scale. Additionally, it
discusses the dynamic nature of style guides, the role of style arbiters, and
the importance of automation tools for enforcing rules consistently across large
codebases.

**Discussion Question: What values do we want to have for our codebases?**

### Creating the Rules

When creating the rules it is important to question why you are making something
a rule. Questions you can ask yourself when think of rules are:

- "What goal or goals are we trying to advance?"
- "Why does this belong in the style guide?" 
- "What value does this rule add to our style guide?"
- "Does the rule bring us closer to our goal or goals?"

These are productive questions because they require you to reflect on why a rule
exists instead of mindlessly creating rules for the sake of having rules.

#### Guiding Principles

Google has the goal of making the codebase manageable while still allowing for
productivity. However there is an important trade-off of making rules. **The
larger the body of rules the more choice is restricted**. So the large body of
rules should always be aiming to lead us towards our goals instead of just
acting as a limiting factor. 

Given this there are some overarching principles to guide in rule development which are: 

- Rules should pull their weight
- Rules should be optimized for the reader
- Rules should be consistent 
- Rules should avoid error-prone and surprising constructs
- Rules should concede to practicalities when necessary 

##### Rules Must Pull their Weight

With more rules it becomes increasingly harder to remember them all. It can also
become more expensive and challenging to maintain the more rules you have. 

Choose to not include rules that are self-evident because they add to everyone's
mental load without being worth it.

For example in the context of our work we will not release debugging `print`
statements in our production code. This rule is likely understood by all of us
already and is not worth adding into an official style guide for that reason. 

##### Optimize for the Reader

Another guiding principle is writing code for the reader rather than the author.
This goes back to the principle **Code is written once but read many times.** 

This means we should adhere to the principle: **Simple to read > Simple to
write**.

**However, there is a trade-off**: More cost more for engineers but easier to
read.

**Ways to make code easier to read**:

- Longer and more descriptive variable names
- Using more descriptive conditional structures
- Descriptive doc-strings
- Well written comments 

**Types of comments**:

- Documentation Comments that describe the design or intent of the code that
follows
- Implementation comments justify or highlight non-obvious choices, underscore
important parts, or explain the tricky parts

#####  Be Consistent

Consistency in code bases and in work spaces makes it easier to jump from
project to project. Think about the setup between `gatorgrade` and `execexam`
both utilize `poetry` so you were familiar with aspects of the tool before
jumping in. That is part of why it is so hard to update `gatorgrader`. It was
written before a lot of the dependencies we use in our other code bases so it is
harder to get a grip on what is happening. That is why it is a task to convert
it to a method that is more consistent with the rest of our code bases. 

**Why consistency is good**:

- Engineers can focus on what's getting done over how it is presented 
- Chunking of problems; solving in a similar way
- Enables scaling code wise; make the code work the same everywhere
- Enables scaling human-wise; mobility across projects
- Resilience to time 

Do not let preserving consistency stop you from updating your code at scale. If
things change the standard may change and past code may need updated such as
with `gatorgrader`

Being consistent starts locally but sometimes standards of the external
community should be taken into account. An example of this that you have used
before is citation standards or the `YAML` standards for `yaml` files. We also
using linting to make sure our codes are up to an outside standard.

An example they use in the book is that Google used to only use 2 space indents
for their Python code but the outside community used 4. Eventually they realized
the Google standard did not fit compared to the outside standard. The more your
code interacts with the outside world the more staying consistent with outside
standards matter.

##### Avoid Error-prone and Surprising Constructs

Even if current developers understand a confusing construct there is no
guarantee the future will. These non-obvious features can cause misuse and
introduce bugs. 

Google's Python style guide avoids using `power` features such as reflection.
`hasattr()` and `getattr()` for example give access to an object using strings.

Here is an example in Python:

The first Python file:
```python
A_CONSTANT = [
'foo',
'bar',
'baz',
]
```

The second Python file:
```python
values = []
for field in some_file.A_CONSTANT:
values.append(getattr(my_object, field))
```

Confusing code can also cause security flaws since this code is hard to test and
can be hard to identify if messages are validated incorrectly.

Some cases `hasattr()` and `getattr()` are valid but in most cases they are
confusing. The traceback feature we have for example is a case where we needed
to use these Python features to grab the information on the source code and
source files. 

There is higher value in code that is understandable and easier to maintain than
code that jumps to get the job done quickly.

##### Concede to Practicalities 

**"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."** - Ralph Waldo
Emerson 

It is okay to have exceptions to the style guide. Do not ignore everything else
just because you are in pursuit of simple and consistent code. When needed
exceptions can be made for optimizations and practicalities that otherwise would
conflict with the rules.

**Discussion Question: Can you describe one of the guiding principles and why it
is important?**

#### The Style Guide

### Changing the Rules 

Style guides are not static. As with many things in software engineering, style
guides are an ever evolving thing. With this being said certain styles can
become outdated based on new features. If a rule is causing engineers to invest
an excess amount of effort that may indicate that a change is needed. When
looking into changing the rules the first thing that is important to evaluate is
why the rule is in place to start. In doing this evaluation it is also important
to have evidence to back up keeping a rule or creating a change. It is also
important to document the reasons for change. In the future it will allow active
users to have a more educated opinion on whether or not the rule is still
effective or needs to be changed. An example of this is Google using CamelCase
as opposed to snake_case naming style for method names.

The reason for this is that most of Google's Python usage at the time was for
C++ developers using Python as a scripting layer on top of a C++ codebase.
Because Google's C++ naming convention follows CamelCase style, it was important
to keep that consistent. When doing this they found that there were other issues
with CamelCase. CamelCase did not conform to the third-party Python libraries
that were being used. This made maintaining CamelCase more complex than it
needed to be. Another downside that was discovered was that this nonconformist
convention was surprising and somewhat weird for the community. Ultimately when
weighing the pros and cons of CamelCase and snake_case Google decided to switch
back to snake_case naming in Python.

#### The Process

The process used at google for changing a style guide is a solution based one.
This means that if an update is proposed it has to be a solution to an existing
problem and not a hypothetical situation.

**Why might this be an effective approach?**

#### The Style Arbiters

At google each language's style guide has to be approved by the style arbiters.
This group is are long-time language experts and are designated to make the
final decisions. With this being said they do not make the decision on their
own. They have to take into account the trade-offs for the proposed change and
each change has to be agreed upon and have a specific goal for the change. 

**At Google this group is composed of a four person committee. Why might you
want an even number on this committee as opposed to an odd number?**

#### Exceptions

Yes, you should follow the rules. However there are times when you may think
that not following a specific rule may save a lot of your time or energy. 

**What do you think you should do in this scenario?**

When wanting to make an exception you should first ask yourself if it is worth
going through the process of doing so. The general rule that is followed is that
exceptions are allowed in cases where it is gauged to be more beneficial to
permit a rule-breaking than to avoid it. An example of this would be breaking
the C++ style guide of not allowing implicit type conversions. However, for
types that are designed to transparently wrap other types, where the underlying
data is still accurately and precisely represented, it is reasonable to allow
implicit conversion. While this is a valid exception it is also important to
note that this rule covers enough broad circumstances that it is still valid to
have in place. 

### Guidance

Guidance can come in many different forms. It can be as simple as pointing to
advice on best practices or as complex as having an in depth conversation on a
nuanced topic. Guidance is supposed to represent the best practices that have
been extracted from lessons learned along the way of getting familiar with style
guides. Think of guides as "shoulds," and rules as "musts."

An example of a pool of guidance is primers. Primers do not delve into every
detail of a topic but they should provide explanations and recommend use. This
can be useful for new members to reference because primers can give you the
necessary information needed to implement a feature without any excess. 

As with many things done at google these guides are covering many issues that
have already occurred. It is not focused on situations that are hypothetical but
instead common issues that have real application. With this being said they are
still pieces of advice, unlike the rules in the style guide. Guidance is more
broad and applied. An example of this would be a short "Tip of the Week" article
that is short and to the point. This is one of the many ways guidance can be
economically offered.

Oftentimes software engineers come into a project with knowledge of a
programming language but lack knowledge in how it applies to a specific company
or project. At Google they provide full-day courses in order to bridge this gap.
This could apply in our team as well. Using knowledge sharing to familiarize
somebody working on a new project or codebase could help to gain traction
leading to better overall development.

### Applying the Rules

#### Error Checkers

Error checkers are invaluable for ensuring that coding standards are
consistently followed. Google uses tools like `clang-tidy` for C++ and `Error
Prone` for Java to automatically identify rule violations and suggest fixes.
These tools are deeply integrated into the development process, which helps
engineers focus on writing quality code without needing to memorize every detail
of the rules.

Here is an interesting insight from this chapter: "When we began using tools to
flag deprecated functions based on source tagging, surfacing both the warning
and the suggested fix in place, the problem of having new usages of deprecated
APIs disappeared almost overnight." This demonstrates how automation not only
enforces rules but also makes compliance nearly effortless for engineers.

By automating rule enforcement, these tools minimize "the variance in how a rule
is interpreted and applied," reducing the risk of inconsistent expectations.
They also scale easily as the organization grows, ensuring that enforcement
costs remain manageable, even with thousands of engineers working on millions of
lines of code.

#### Code Formatters

Formatting debates are a common frustration for engineers, but automated
formatters resolve them effectively. Tools like `clang-format` for C++, `gofmt`
for Go, and `dartfmt` for Dart enforce consistent code styles across projects.
At Google, these formatters are run automatically as part of presubmit checks,
ensuring that all code complies before it’s submitted.

Go’s formatter, `gofmt`, provides a compelling case study. Though some
developers initially resisted its strict formatting rules, it quickly became a
feature they valued. “Go programmers expect that all Go code is formatted with
`gofmt`,” making it easier to read, share, and maintain code. Standardized
formatting also enables tools to make updates without generating confusing or
unnecessary changes, streamlining the review process.

## Reflection

Rules in software engineering are essential because they reinforce the values of
the project and guide thoughtful development. However, the process of creating
and maintaining rules requires balance. Rules should advance clear goals without
adding unnecessary mental load. For example, choosing to omit self-evident rules
like "Do not leave debugging prints in production" prevents over-complicating
the style guide.

Google’s approach highlights the importance of optimizing for the reader,
ensuring consistency, and avoiding constructs that are error-prone or confusing.
These principles not only make codebases easier to maintain but also enable
scaling—both in terms of engineering teams and the longevity of projects. While
consistency is valuable, flexibility and practicality should also be considered
to accommodate exceptions or evolving standards. 

Ultimately, rules are not static but require thoughtful revision. By evaluating
rules based on evidence and documented trade-offs, engineering teams can
maintain a balance between enforcing standards and allowing innovation.

## Action Items

To improve style guide practices, start by defining the core values of your
project, such as consistency, readability, or performance optimization, and use
these values to guide rule creation. Automation can be a powerful tool in this
process; tools like `clang-tidy`, `gofmt`, and other linters can streamline rule
enforcement, ensuring compliance without overburdening team members.

Prioritize writing code with the reader in mind by using clear variable names,
descriptive comments, and consistent formatting. While striving for consistency
across projects, maintain flexibility by allowing justified exceptions and
accommodating external standards when necessary. Documenting these exceptions
ensures clarity and transparency.

Lastly, invest in knowledge sharing to help team members understand and apply
the style guide effectively. Resources such as primers, training sessions, or
concise "tip-of-the-week" articles can help bridge knowledge gaps and foster
alignment across the team. By implementing these steps, your team can establish
a style guide that supports both high-quality code and efficient collaboration.
