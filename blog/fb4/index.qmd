## Overview

This is our fourth post about the [The Fuzzing
Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/)! The goal of this post is to relate the
material from the book to our progress on our
[Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten) tool, with the hope that it
will provide valuable lessons on how we approach designing and developing our
own software. Part of this is guidance on automating tests, and how that may
look in different coding languages &mdash; although the article's main focus is
the Python programming language.
