## Overview

This is our first post about the [The Debugging
Book](https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Intro_Debugging.html)! The goal of
this post is to introduce different debugging methods and utilize these methods
within our [Chasten](https://github.com/AstuteSource/chasten) and
[Cellveyor](https://github.com/GatorEducator/cellveyor) tools.

## Summary

The ["Introduction to
Debugging"](https://www.debuggingbook.org/html/Intro_Debugging.html) chapter
explores the topic of debugging through the example of fixing issues in a
Python program that removes HTML tags. It explores common debugging challenges
and introduces a systematic approach using the scientific method. A specific
example involves testing a hypothesis about quote handling and using assertions
for confirmation. The importance of a clear diagnosis and post-fix steps like
testing, adding assertions, committing changes, and closing bug reports is
emphasized. Overall, it provides insights into effective debugging strategies
and the significance of thorough documentation in the process.

The chapter also introduces a systematic debugging strategy based on the
scientific method. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the code,
fixing the problem instead of symptoms, and proceeding systematically. The
scientific method is applied to debugging, involving formulating hypotheses,
making predictions, testing hypotheses through experiments, and refining
hypotheses based on observations.

The chapter provides a specific example where a hypothesis about the removal of
double quotes from tagged input is tested and confirmed using the `assert`
statement. The debugging process involves identifying defects, faults, and
failures, and tracing the cause-effect chain to locate and fix the underlying
issues. The passage concludes by highlighting the challenges of debugging,
including the complexity of program states and the lack of specifications:

```python
# Initial code segment with the hypothesis
elif c == '"' or c == "'" and tag:
    assert False  # <=== Just added
    quote = not quote
```

To test the hypothesis, the author introduces an `assert` statement to check
whether the condition is faulty. They run the program with an input that
triggers this condition:

```python
result = remove_html_markup_with_quote_assert('"foo"')
```

The correct fix involves adding parentheses to ensure the corrected condition:

```python
elif (c == '"' or c == "'") and tag:
    quote = not quote
```

The incorrect condition fails to handle single and double quotes correctly. The
corrected condition ensures that the code inside the block is executed only
when either a single or double quote is encountered and the `tag` variable is
true.

After fixing the code, the author suggests post-fix activities, including
checking for further occurrences of the defect, validating tests, adding
assertions for future correctness checks, committing the fix to the code
repository, and closing the bug report. These activities ensure the long-term
health and correctness of a software application.

## Reflection

After reading and interpreting this article, we as software engineers can learn
more about debugging. We learn about how simple debugging is and how we can
make it legible with Python. Debugging means to simultaneously find and fix
problems within our code. The author wants developers to approach debugging by
using the scientific method.

In the chapter, a Python function is used to explore the debugging process. In
the function there is a bug which causes the function to not work properly. The
article shows step by step whats wrong and how to debug this function. The
message being conveyed in this article is to simply use a systematic and
methodical approach when going about debugging.

To conclude, the article talks about how to find and debug errors in different
programs. It talks about how to go about debugging in order to get the best
results possible. Ultimately, the article makes it clear both what a software
engineer does during the process of debugging and how debugging improves the
overall quality of software.

## Action Items

The cause-and-effect chain can be helpful to keep in mind when writing test
cases for our code. Having a deeper understanding of the steps in the
cause-and-effect chain can allow us to write better test cases to debug our
program. Knowing that the chain starts with a human action that results in an
error which then results in errors in the code may help us figure out how to
debug a section of the program or an input that causes an error. Using the idea
of the scientific method in this chapter can also be beneficial to look at bugs
that are within the program or function. Taking the approach of the scientific
method and creating a hypothesis as to what might be causing the error that the
program or function is producing is a good first step in diagnosing the bug.
Predicting what may happen when you modify a section or piece of code and
checking it to see if the output is what you predicted it to be will help us
debug a program or function. Overall this chapter gives key insights into the
ideology to use when debugging a function or program.
